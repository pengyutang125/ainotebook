Program D is the most widely used free ("open source") AIML bot platform in the world. 
It is the most feature-complete, best-tested implementation of the current AIML specification. 
It supports unlimited multiple bots in a single server instance, and has an open-ended architecture 
for interacting via any interface imaginable. The standard release provides a J2EE web application 
implementation that can be deployed as a .war file. 

Drop-in listeners are available for IRC, AIM, and Yahoo. It includes an automated testing framework for testing knowledge bases, 
and is packaged with an AIML Test Suite that verifies that the program itself complies to the AIML specification.
